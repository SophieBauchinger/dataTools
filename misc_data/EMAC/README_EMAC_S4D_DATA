The Chemistry Climate Model (CCM) simulation conducted with the
ECHAM/MESSY Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model.
The Simulation has "specified dynamics" (SD), i.e. is nudged using
Newtonian Relaxation in the free troposphere (up until 100 hPa) towards ERA5
reanalysis data.
The simulation collects a large list of variables along flight tracks given the path of the aircrafts as input.

The temporal output frequency is 12 minutes. The output is saved into monthly
files per aircraft.

The value is approximated by either nearest neighbour (n) or bilinear (b)
interpolation using the flight track and the EMAC global Gaussian Grid with a
horizontal discretisation into 128 longitudes and 64 latitudes.
If a surprising value is found in one interpolation, the other should be
checked.

The entire curtain, i.e. the model output on all 90 vertical levels, is written
out. The output can be vertically subsampled (_s) to the aircraft location to
held only one value.

The naming convention is as such:

YYYYMM_s4d_{n/b}{aircraft abbreviation}{_s}.nc

e.g.

200804_s4d_bCARIB2.nc
Contains the model output on all model levels along the CARIBIC-2
flight campaign from April 2008. Each value is interpolated using bilinear
interpolation.

200804_s4d_bCARIB2_s.nc
The output is additionally vertically subsampled at the location of the
aircraft.


To regrid from the native vertical model layers to pressure levels,
the calculation is

press = (hyam + hybm * tps)/100

in hPa. This works only for files containing the entire curtain.
